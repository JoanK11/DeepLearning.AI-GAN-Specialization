# Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization by DeepLearning.AI
All programming assignments from the DeepLearning.AI [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans) are compiled in this repository to serve as educational resources for those interested in learning about GAN creation.

## Courses
The Coursera GAN Specialization is comprised of three courses:
- [Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans)
- [Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-better-generative-adversarial-networks-gans)
- [Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apply-generative-adversarial-networks-gans)

## About GANs
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs.

- Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more. 

## About this Specialization
- The DeepLearning.AI GAN Specialization provides an exciting introduction to image generation with GANs, charting a path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques through an easy-to-understand approach. It also covers social implications, including bias in ML and the ways to detect it, privacy preservation, and more.

- Build a comprehensive knowledge base and gain hands-on experience in GANs. Train your own model using PyTorch, use it to create images, and evaluate a variety of advanced GANs. 

## About you
- This Specialization is for software engineers, students, and researchers from any field, who are interested in machine learning and want to understand how GANs work.

- This Specialization provides an accessible pathway for all levels of learners looking to break into the GANs space or apply GANs to their own projects, even without prior familiarity with advanced math and machine learning research.

## Reference Solutions
To acknowledge the difficulties people face when building intuition, understanding new concepts, and debugging assignments, I've uploaded solutions for reference purposes only. These solutions are intended to assist if you become stuck somewhere. Please avoid copying any part of the code verbatim, as the programming assignments are relatively straightforward if you read the instructions carefully.
